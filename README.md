# UX_Designs
Here are the files of my designs along with their description.
1.  **Musicians_Connect_Application_Prototype**: The application Musicians Connect is a web application helpful for small-scale artists to get in touch with other artists, get events to perform at, and post an advertisement of their own event. I have designed this prototype in adobe xd.
2.  **Video_chat_for_Elderly_Design_Prototype**: A simple video calling web application for the elderly with only the necessary functionalities needed by them. This web application was designed to take elderly into the consideration and the problems they face while using an application, that was gathered through a survey.
3.  **Morning_Star_Landing_Page**: It's amongst the first designs when I started my specialization. In the pdf, you can see the landing page of a cafe.
4. **Timeline_Infographic_Of_a_Data_Breach**: It is a timeline of the Slickwraps data breach which I had presented using an infographic.
5. **Infographics_On_Dashboards**: This is yet another infographic I made to summarise the paper which I presented. (Paper: What do we talk about when we talk about dashboards?)
